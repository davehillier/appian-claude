# Power Statement Generator Skill

## Purpose

Generate compelling, client-focused sales positioning that leads with customer pain points and desired outcomes rather than product features.

---

## The Core Philosophy: It's Not About You

**Key insight:** Prospects don't care what you do. They care what you can do for *them*.

The Power Statement inverts the typical self-absorbed sales pitch. Instead of "We do this, that, and the other thing," we lead with the issues, pains, and results that matter to the customer.

**The Test:** Apply the "So What?" test to every statement. If a prospect could reasonably respond "So what?", the statement fails.

---

## When to Use

- Crafting sales positioning for a new product, service, or market
- Preparing for sales calls, presentations, or proposals
- Creating email campaigns and drip sequences
- Developing LinkedIn outreach messaging
- Onboarding new sales team members with consistent messaging
- Reframing an existing, self-focused sales story

## The Power Statement Structure

A Power Statement consists of five components, in strict sequence:

### 1. Headline (1-2 sentences)
A brief introduction providing context. Helps the audience place you in a category.

**Pattern:**
> [Company Name] is [brief descriptor]. We work with [target audience] to [high-level outcome].

### 2. Transitional Phrase
Sets the stage to share client issues. Positions statements as if they were testimonials from your best clients.

**Pattern:**
> [Target role/company type] look to [Company Name] when...
>
> *or*
>
> [Industry] executives turn to us when they...

### 3. Client Issues Addressed (3-7 items)
The power. The sharp tip of your sales spear. Use conversational, bulleted format with provocative or emotionally charged words.

**Patterns:**
- Striving to achieve [Result]
- Frustrated from dealing with [Pain] and ready to take action
- Under significant pressure to eliminate [Problem]
- Committed to accomplishing [Outcome]
- They've had it with [Frustration]
- Facing [regulatory/competitive/cost] pressure from [Issue]
- Finally tired of living with [Problem] and want help tackling it
- Seeking a competitive advantage by [Desired State]
- Embarrassed by [Current Shortcoming]
- There is no peace of mind regarding [Risk Area]

### 4. Offerings (Brief)
What you actually sell. Keep this short - it's the least compelling component. Sandwiched between the attention-grabbing issues and the differentiating close.

**Pattern:**
> We provide [Category]. [Company Name] services include [Service 1], [Service 2], and [Service 3].

### 5. Differentiators (5+ items)
Why you're the best choice. This is where you can demonstrate value - but with substance, not hyperbole.

**Lead-in pattern:**
> [Company Name] continues to [grow/dominate/succeed] because we are very different from what you will find in the marketplace...

**Differentiator patterns:**
- We are a true [unique capability]
- We offer [unique benefit] that helps clients [achieve outcome]
- We are "[philosophy]," allowing us to [benefit]
- No one [handles/delivers/responds] better or faster
- We have, without question, the [superlative capability]
- Our clients don't [negative behaviour]. [Evidence of loyalty]
- It is personal. [Commitment statement]

---

## Discovery Questions (Bonus Output)

After the Power Statement, generate 4-6 open-ended discovery questions derived from the client issues. These questions:
- Turn the issue statements into probing questions
- Invite the prospect to share their pain
- Position you as a problem solver, not a product pusher

**Pattern:**
- What do you wish your current [solution] could do that it isn't doing now?
- Tell me about the last time [pain point] occurred. What was the impact?
- We often hear about [common frustration]. What behaviours would you like to see changed?
- Under your current setup, what happens when [risk scenario] strikes?
- What is the opportunity cost of continuing with [current approach]?

---

## Research Phase

Before drafting, the skill may perform web research to understand:

1. **The target industry** - Current trends, regulatory pressures, competitive dynamics
2. **The target buyer persona** - Common pain points, priorities, language they use
3. **Competitor positioning** - What alternatives are saying (to differentiate against)
4. **Recent news/events** - Burning platforms that create urgency

### Research Questions to Guide Discovery

**Why do your best customers initially come to you?**
- What business problems were they facing?
- What results were they looking to achieve?

**What pains do prospects experience from choosing/staying with the wrong provider?**
- What happens when they choose a competitor?
- What are they likely missing out on?

**What problems arise from self-performing (instead of outsourcing to you)?**
- What's the opportunity cost of not working with you?
- Which results fall short because they're not your customer?

## Example: Appian Corporation Power Statement

### Headline
Appian is the enterprise platform for process orchestration. We work with Global 2000 organisations to unify their people, data, and systems into end-to-end processes that drive business outcomes.

### Transitional Phrase & Client Issues Addressed

CIOs and Operations Leaders turn to Appian when:

- Frustrated that their automation investments (RPA, workflow tools, point solutions) have created more silos, not less - and the promised ROI never materialised.
- Under significant pressure to modernise without the risk, cost, and disruption of a "rip and replace" migration.
- Committed to achieving a "Clean Core" ERP strategy but lack the orchestration layer to move customisations out of SAP or Oracle.
- They've had it with "swivel-chair" processes - staff re-keying data across disconnected systems whilst customers wait.
- Facing regulatory pressure to demonstrate auditable, compliant processes to external bodies.
- Seeking a competitive advantage by delivering services faster than their peers, without adding headcount.
- There is no peace of mind regarding the fragility of their end-to-end processes; a single point failure brings operations to a halt.

### Offerings
We provide an AI-powered process platform. Appian services include low-code application development, process automation, case management, data fabric, and intelligent document processing.

### Differentiators

Appian continues to dominate the process orchestration space because we are very different from other available alternatives:

1. **We complete, not compete.** Appian wraps around your existing investments (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, ServiceNow) rather than demanding you replace them.
2. **We are "Data Fabric" pioneers.** We connect and virtualise data from 200+ sources - no migration, no ETL, no duplication. Connect, don't copy.
3. **No one delivers faster.** Our customers go from concept to production in weeks, not years. Low-code development is 10x faster than traditional approaches.
4. **We are platform-agnostic.** Deploy on Appian Cloud, your private cloud, or on-premises. No vendor lock-in for infrastructure.
5. **Security is in our DNA.** FedRAMP, SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA - we meet the most stringent compliance requirements in government and financial services.
6. **Our clients don't leave us.** Net retention rates above 115% year after year. The customers who do leave come back.

## Discovery Questions

Use these questions to probe for the issues listed above:

1. What has been your experience with automation investments over the past few years - RPA, workflow tools, and the like? Did they deliver the ROI you expected?
2. Tell me about your current modernisation strategy for legacy systems. What's the biggest barrier to moving faster?
3. How are you approaching your "Clean Core" strategy for SAP or Oracle? What happens to the customisations?
4. We often hear about staff re-keying data between systems. Where do you see that happening most in your organisation?
5. When was the last time a single point of failure impacted end-to-end operations? How was it handled?
6. If you could accelerate one process by 50%, which would have the biggest business impact?

## Usage Notes

### Internal Document Only
The Power Statement is an internal source document, not a handout. Use it to:
- Pull excerpts for introductory letters
- Create drip email campaigns
- Develop talking points for sales calls
- Craft probing questions for discovery

### Adaptation for Different Channels

**For email:**
> We serve [target role] who are telling us they're facing [Issue 1], which requires immediate attention, or they are working to solve [Issue 2], which if not addressed is causing [Issue 3].

**For voicemail:**
> [Company Name] works with [target audience] who are [Issue 1] or [Issue 2]. I'd love to learn if any of those resonate with your situation.

**For proposals:**
Lead with the Client Issues section before describing the solution.

---

## Style Rules

### Do
- Lead with pains, problems, and results - never with offerings
- Use provocative, emotionally charged language for issues
- Keep offerings brief (the least compelling section)
- Include at least 5 differentiators with substance
- Derive discovery questions directly from the issues

### Don't
- Use hyperbole ("game-changing," "revolutionary")
- Lead with product features or company history
- Write long, self-absorbed paragraphs about the company
- Use jargon without context
- Forget the "So What?" test

---

## The Sequence Matters

**Never** change the order of the three building blocks:

1. **Client Issues** - The sharp tip of the spear (leads)
2. **Offerings** - Brief, factual, unpretentious (middle)
3. **Differentiators** - Substantive reasons to choose you (closes)

Leading with offerings screams "commodity." Leading with differentiators risks appearing self-absorbed. Leading with issues demonstrates you understand the prospect's world - and positions you as a problem solver before you've even described what you sell.
